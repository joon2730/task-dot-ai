# Tasket – AI-Powered ToDo & Reminder App

**Tasket** is a lightweight, AI-assisted task and reminder app designed to help users quickly capture and structure their thoughts. Whether it's a to-do item, recurring event, or shopping list, Tasket automatically organizes tasks with due dates, checklists, and repeat rules — all from natural language input.

Currently in beta via **TestFlight**. App Store release scheduled for **June 2025**.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Input**  
  Type tasks as you would say them — e.g., “Pick up groceries every Friday” — and Tasket handles the rest.

- **Automatic Structuring**  
  Each input is parsed into a structured task, with fields like title, due date, subtasks, and repeat schedule.

- **Recurring Tasks**  
  Supports daily, weekly, and monthly repeats with flexible intervals.

- **Smart Checklists**  
  Detects lists and sub-actions directly from your input.

- **Realtime Sync**  
  Tasks are synced instantly across devices using Firebase Firestore.

- **Minimal, Fast Interface**  
  Optimized for clarity, gesture interaction, and dark mode support.
