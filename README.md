# ✅ Tasket – AI-Powered ToDo & Reminder App

**Tasket** is a lightweight, AI-assisted task and reminder app designed to help users quickly capture and structure their thoughts. Whether it's a to-do item, recurring event, or shopping list, Tasket automatically organizes tasks with due dates, checklists, and repeat rules — all from natural language input.

Currently in beta via **TestFlight**. App Store release scheduled for **June 2025**.

- **Recurring Tasks**  
  Supports daily, weekly, and monthly repeats with flexible intervals.

- **Smart Checklists**  
  Detects lists and sub-actions directly from your input.
